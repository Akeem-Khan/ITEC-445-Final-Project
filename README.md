Project Specification
    Account Management:
        Users can register an account upon which they will receive an email with an activation link to verify their account. Users can then login with their registered credentials.
        A user can possess 1 of 3 roles: Student, Pending, Student Leader and Faculty. The default role is decided by the email entered when registering all emails ending with @costaatt.edu.tt is given the Faculty role any other email is given the Student role.
        Via their profile page a student can apply to become a Student Leader. This will set their role to Pending which has the same permissions as a Student until they are approved by a faculty member then their role will be updated to Student Leader.

    Notices Management:
        Notices can only be published by Student Leaders and Faculty members. A notice can only be edited by its author, however, a faculty member has the power to flag notices which will replace its contents with the faculty members information until it is unflagged. A flagged notice can still be edited by its author but the changes will not be published until the flag is removed.

    Direct Messaging:
        There is a built-in chat feature that allows users to communicate with one another in real in real time. On the chat page simply search for the user you want to chat with and begin chatting. Users also have the option to delete existing chats.
